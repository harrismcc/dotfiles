## General Rules
- NEVER make git commits unless the user explicitly asks for it, and confirms each time.
- Don't guess about library APIs, use the context7 mcp to get accurate info.
- If you are running a long-running process, such as a dev server, use the `timeout` command every time to makes sure it doesn't run forever.
